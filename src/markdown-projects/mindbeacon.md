MindBeacon provides online mental health support. This isn't my first time hearing about online mental health support. I first heard about this through the creator of [FunFunFunction](https://www.youtube.com/c/funfunfunction) (I pretty much learned JavaScript through his channel) moving to [Mindler](https://mindler.se/). This was before the pandemic so the significance of online mental health support access isn't as obvious.

At MindBeacon, I want to commit to better tests in the code that I write. TDD has always been on the horizon but I've never committed to using it before. Exploring a brand new code base with TDD as a form of REPL development for fast feedback felt pretty nice. You are contributing tests, catching errors, and learning about the codebase all at the same time.

In the push for better DX, I've revisited environment issues for for Angular, Node, and Storybook. JavaScript still has some hard to replicate errors that pops up only for some developers using specific workflows. Resolving them let the team code with confidence and ultimately saves development time.

Storybook was everything I'd hoped it would be for UX development. It's easy to setup and use. Quick to write and update. However, it's sadly not  compatible with Angular. There are lifecycle inconsistencies, un-rendered visuals, and awkward DX. Hopefully these issues are only temporary and will be addressed beyond 2021. If you use React? Go for it.

Cypress is easy to use and setup, but my expertise isn't in DevOps. So far, it's already proving it's use and reduces the repetitive end-to-end tests QA would have to do for feature launches. I enjoy using Cypress to write tests and hope to see more of it.
