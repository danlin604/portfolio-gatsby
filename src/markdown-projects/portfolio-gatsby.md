You are looking at it!

A lot of the time sinks on previous websites came from integrating libraries and frameworks. A-frame to React. P3 to React. D3 to Gatsby. There are too many libraries to maintain a living project. I want to avoid doing so this time around and make the content more portable.

Content are now written in markdown and projects are hosted separately on GitHub pages.
