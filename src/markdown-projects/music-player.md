Android Music Player is a student group project for the mobile development course in BCIT. It allows for `.flac` playback as well as commonly supported file extensions. It plays music asynchronously and recursively scans through the user's media folders. It follows the 2016 Android permission guidelines. I worked on the playback, permissions, and file scanning since mobile development caught my interest.
