This is my very first website. Key concepts here are self-executing scripts, ES5 syntax, partial re-render of web elements, and HTML/CSS design patterns.

Here you can find my attempt at a JS Fiddle and a CSS painting. At one point, project polymer came out and an early version of this website started to use it. Sadly regression occurred at some point so I reverted this project to its pre-polymer commit.
