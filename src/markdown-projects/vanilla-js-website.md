Portfolio website created to teach myself basics of web development. Key concepts learned from the project are self-executing JS scripts, ES5 syntax, partial re-render of web element, and HTML/CSS design patterns. You can find my a attempt at a JS Fiddle that dangerously uses `eval()` and a CSS scene based on a photograph.

I built this website as a way to learn JavaScript after graduation. JavaScript was foreign to me and I wanted an excuse to fully explore the language. I was committed in interviewing solely in a new language so that I can quickly learn its syntax.
