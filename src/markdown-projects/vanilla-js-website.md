A website to learn the basics of web development. Key concepts are self-executing JS scripts, ES5 syntax, partial re-render of web elements, and HTML/CSS design patterns.

Here you can find my attempt at a JS Fiddle and a CSS scene. Sadly regression occurred at some point so I reverted this project to its pre-Polymer commit.
