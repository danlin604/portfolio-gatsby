BarterBay uses Next.js, React Native, Node.js, PostgreSQL, and AWS services. My focuses are the following:

- Business & marketing research
- Business proposals
- Terms of service & user agreements
- React Native development
- Authentication services
- Security
- PostgreSQL functions & schema designs

Most of the complex business logic for our bartering system is located in the PostgreSQL database:

- Full-text search
- Anonymized GIS
- Bartering system
- Real-time chat
- Authentication

We work in a small team consisting of the CEO, designer, and developers. The environment is informal but has a heavy emphasis on research and design. Every design is analyzed by the team and goes through a _dogfooding_ process. We end up with an in-depth understanding of our system and our business needs, which increased our _confidence in our designs_.

Much of the time is spent on these design meetings, which may be a necessary cost. I end up with a great love for the _whiteboarding_ process and _sequence diagrams_ here.
