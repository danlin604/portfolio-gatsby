BarterBay uses Next.js, React Native, Node.js, PostgreSQL, and AWS services. My focuses are the following:

* Business & marketing research
* Business proposals
* Terms of service & user agreements
* React Native development
* Authentication services
* Security
* PostgreSQL functions & schema designs

Most of the complex business logic for our bartering system is located in the PostgreSQL database:

* Full-text search
* Anonymized GIS
* Bartering system
* Real-time chat
* Authentication

The justification for using PostgreSQL so heavily is because it is capable of handling complex transactions quickly and with low latency. Our February 2018 launch validates this architectural choice.

I worked in a small team consisting of the CEO, designer, and two other developers. The environment is informal but has a heavy emphasis on research and design. Every design is analyzed by the team and goes through a *dogfooding* process. We end up with an in-depth understanding of our system and our business needs, which increased our *confidence in our designs*.

Much of the time is spent on these design meetings, which may be a necessary cost. I end up with a great love for the *whiteboarding* process and *sequence diagrams* here.
