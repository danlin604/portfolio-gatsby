One of the goals of this project is to learn more about Webpack. CRA ships with performant builds but Webpack isn't directly exposed. My previous CRA website also requires me to code a lot of the content, all of which require individual styling. Performance goes down as I integrate more libraries. CSS is another concern because libraries such as P5.js impacts styles.

Maintainability is the theme of this project. I've converted my resume to a Markdown file to separate content from code. Styling the `.md` in a single stylesheet saves me a lot of future work.

In this project you can find emoji animation, imported P5 starfield animation, and a solar system built in A-Frame. I am trying out subdomain prefixing to see if it makes sense to separate future projects this way.

*Update:*

Ideas from this project is now moved to the portfolio-gatsby project instead. Using markdown is a good idea but hosting individual projects requires integration work between the framework and whatever library or technology the project will be using. Libraries can too easily be incompatible.
