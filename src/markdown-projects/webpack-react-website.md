A co-worker convinced me to dig deeper into Webpack so I began a new portfolio website. Initially, my plan was to convert the 2018 website to Gatsby, but none of the styles imported well so I ended up trying to fix more breakages then to actually learn new thing! The excuse of learning Webpack is what was needed for me to start from scratch. You can see that I am really taken with Markdown and began converting a more portable version of my resume. because by now this is my fourth website, and I am looking for a way to write less. You can find animated emoji, imported P5 starfield animation, and a solar-system built in A-Frame.
