I started working at SAAB through BCIT's Co-op program for two semesters. There are two major projects there:

* Migrating legacy Delphi application to C#
* Reports for various ports

[SAAB](https://saab.com/) is a Swedish aerospace and defense company. SAAB Technologies, based in Burnaby, is part of its maritime traffic management division. Working here exposes me to a lot of maritime subjects outside of my experiences.

Migrating and updating tariff scripts from the 2-tier Delphi application to the new n-tier C# application for the Port of Papua New Guinea helped me learn the basic syntax for both languages. It is a good opportunity to learn the business logic for ports.

I create web and client T-SQL scripts for port departments. The data is parsed by FastReport for printable views. They show business, financial, and resource information for stakeholders. These scripts can be complex SQL queries and require an in-depth understanding of database schemas.

I also document and update requirements for Port Everglades.
