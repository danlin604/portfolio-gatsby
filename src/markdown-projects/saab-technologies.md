[SAAB](https://saab.com/) is a Swedish aerospace and defense company. SAAB Technologies, based in Burnaby, is part of its maritime traffic management division. I worked at SAAB through BCIT's Co-op program for two semesters mostly on:

- Migrating legacy Delphi application to C#
- SQL reports for various ports

Migrating and updating tariff scripts from the 2-tier Delphi application to the newer n-tier C# application for the Port of Papua New Guinea is a good way to learn the basic syntax for both languages. It is an opportunity to learn the business logic for the port.

Client T-SQL scripts are written for port departments. The data is parsed by FastReport for printable views. They show business, financial, and resource information for port stakeholders. These scripts can be complex SQL queries and require an in-depth understanding of database schemas.
