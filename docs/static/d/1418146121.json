It is similar to React Native as they share the same React library. CSS translates well between these frameworks.</p>\n<p>This website is built on top of <code>create-react-app</code>, and the default starter is highly optimized. Very little work needs to be done to get started. There are some parts where I had to dig in further, such as their cache-busting implementation and how CRA abstracts away Webpack.</p>\n<p>I heard good things about <code>styled-components</code> before starting on my website. The speaker claims that refactoring non-styled-component CSS to <code>styled-component</code> is a <em>totally zen</em> experience. They got me <em>curious</em>. Not having to worry about interfering CSS styles and confidently write CSS with no worry is an attractive feature. So I gave it a try! I love the CSS isolation, and I like the first-class component support. <code>styled-component</code> has the potential to solve a lot of React CSS issues. I'd recommend them if developers struggle with leaky styles.</p>\n<p>I played a little bit with <code>p5.js</code> integration in React. I am able to get them working.
