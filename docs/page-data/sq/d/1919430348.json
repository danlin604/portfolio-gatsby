This isn't my first time hearing about online mental health support. I first heard about this through the creator of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/funfunfunction\">FunFunFunction</a> (I pretty much learned JavaScript through his channel) moving to <a href=\"https://mindler.se/\">Mindler</a>. This was before the pandemic so the significance of online mental health support access isn't as obvious.</p>\n<p>At MindBeacon, I want to commit to better tests in the code that I write. TDD has always been on the horizon but I've never committed to using it before. Exploring a brand new code base with TDD as a form of REPL development for fast feedback felt pretty nice. You are contributing tests, catching errors, and learning about the codebase all at the same time.</p>\n<p>In the push for better DX, I've revisited environment issues for for Angular, Node, and Storybook. JavaScript still has some hard to replicate errors that pops up only for some developers using specific workflows. Resolving them let the team code with confidence and ultimately saves development time.</p>\n<p>Storybook was everything I'd hoped it would be for UX development. It's easy to setup and use. Quick to write and update. However, it's sadly not  compatible with Angular. There are lifecycle inconsistencies, un-rendered visuals, and awkward DX. Hopefully these issues are only temporary and will be addressed beyond 2021. If you use React? Go for it.</p>\n<p>Cypress is easy to use and setup, but my expertise isn't in DevOps. So far, it's already proving it's use and reduces the repetitive end-to-end tests QA would have to do for feature launches. I enjoy using Cypress to write tests and hope to see more of it.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"MindBeacon","startDate":"August 03, 2021","endDate":"September 26, 2021","description":"Virtual Mental Health Therapy Clinic","url":"https://www.mindbeacon.com/","source":null}}}},{"node":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"id":"3a013a6c-e969-55f8-8778-7a2f5e700878","html":"<p>Policy Reporter provides accurate data and reports in the healthcare landscape. Stakeholders are doctors, insurance companies, and manufacturers. It's business is data.</p>\n<p>Even though the framework is old, the patterns we use in the backend are well tested are well established. The team promoted testing which is great. I've neglected testing in my previous work. It's something I want to do but never found the time for when chasing after features. I grew to be more thoughtful about tests because of this test first culture.</p>\n<p>I am happy to work closely with Postgres again on a data-heavy visualization project. It's always a little daunting to commit to a database schema. Is it correct? Is it future proof? Is the business well understood? It's almost like a theory. You want to challenge the schema as much as possible before you are <em>stuck</em> with it. While the schema isn't immutable, the effort to change it can be just as daunting as the initial design. Is it correct? Will migrations work? Is it future proof?</p>\n<p>I came away with some thoughts on this.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You want a living document that captures up-to-date schema</li>\n<li>The schema should allow for easy updates</li>\n<li>The schema should allow for easy inserts</li>\n<li>The schema should allow for easy deletions</li>\n<li>The schema should get feedback from <em>all</em> stakeholders because it is how we see the business data</li>\n<li>The schema should allow for performant reads</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Projects will have to move on but you can always try your best to validate the above as much as possible between development and launch.</p>\n<p>Previously at BarterBay I had to work alone on Postgres so my resources were limited. I've always wanted to work with another developer experienced with Postgres. So it has been a pleasure to just chat and learn new tricks and dig more into query optimization. I can't say I have a very structured method to optimization yet. You run the query. You observe the query planner and performance. You look for places where optimization that would make an impact. The process isn't as speedy or obvious yet, but I can feel that overtime it'll become more straightforward.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Policy Reporter","startDate":"April 03, 2020","endDate":"July 30, 2021","description":"Up to Date Medical Policy Database","url":"https://www.policyreporter.com/","source":null}}}},{"node":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"id":"6396ef23-12c5-5cbc-8598-9d0b537f25d6","html":"<p>Gapminder visualization is my first experiment with D3. I've had the opportunity to use other visualization libraries in previous projects but never D3. I've always wanted to use D3. It seems to be the most flexible visualization library out there.

React relies on the <code>Virtual DOM</code> and creates a lot of friction with D3. Some integration code is required to get the two libraries to work together.

Very little work needs to be done to get started.

The speaker claims that refactoring non-styled-component CSS to <code>styled-component</code> is a <em>totally zen</em> experience. They got me <em>curious</em>. Not having to worry about interfering CSS styles and confidently write CSS with no worry is an attractive feature. So I gave it a try! I love the CSS isolation, and I like the first-class component support. <code>styled-component</code> has the potential to solve a lot of React CSS issues. I'd recommend them if developers struggle with leaky styles.</p>\n<p>I played a little bit with <code>p5.js</code> integration in React. I can get them working.
